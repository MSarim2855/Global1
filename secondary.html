    <!-- Sections -->
         <div id="causes" class="section">
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>A major cause of digital illiteracy among elderly people is their physical and cognitive decline. Ageing comes with loss of eyesight, slower memory, slower processing of information, and hearing loss etc. This makes it harder for them to use small screens and navigate through menus. Because of this, elderly people avoid technology. (Fadzil, 2023)</p>
        <p>Furthermore, lack of proper education and exposure is also a significant cause. Unlike today’s generations, they did not grow up surrounded by digital devices such as mobile phones, laptops etc. As a result, they lack the fundamental digital concepts. According to the journal “European Journal of Psychiatry”, lack of education contributes to weaker computer skills and internet use. (Augner, 2022).</p>
        <p>Additionally, lack of support and motivation leads to digital illiteracy among the elderly people. Many people cannot afford devices like mobile phones and even if they have the devices, they do not have proper training or motivation to use them. If younger people do not explain to them patiently, they lose confidence and remain excluded from digital participation.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Consequences -->
    <div id="consequences" class="section">
        <h2>Consequences</h2>
        <p>A significant consequence of digital illiteracy is social isolation. In today’s era, communication is shifting to online platforms like social media or messaging apps. This makes them struggle to stay connected to their family and friends. This isolation can lead to loneliness and even depression. (Augner, 2022)</p>
        <p>Moreover, essential facilities like banking, healthcare, government services and even shopping are slowly becoming digital. Elderly people who cannot navigate through these menus, face difficulties in using these services. This gap makes the elderly dependent on the young people.</p>
        <p>In addition, digital illiteracy causes reduced autonomy and participation in society. Without it (digital literacy), elderly people are unable to take part in the online education or civic participation (such as e-voting). This limits their personal growth and reinforces stereotypes of elderly people as incapable of using the technology.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Global Perspective -->
    <div id="global" class="section">
        <h2>Global Perspective</h2>
        <p>Digital illiteracy among senior citizen has been a prevalent issue throughout the world. Old people often suffer from various daily life issues due to their lack of digital skills. According to data from the UNECE, only 1 in 4 older Europeans have basic or above basic digital skills. Furthermore, a large-scale study found that the lack of digital literacy significantly lowers the life quality of older people. Moreover, they often find themselves having restricted access to health services, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation (nih.gov). eHealth literacy is the ability to use electronic devices to get the health services one needs.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive study regarding the eHealth Literacy of older adults, concluded that the average eHealth Literacy score of senior citizens was 21.45 which is significantly lower than the passing score of 32 (biomedcentral.com). The United Nations calls for “digital literacy for all whether young or old". The UN Secretary-General said “perhaps no population could benefit more from support, than older persons” (un.org).</p>
        <p>In order to solve this issue, the UNESCO runs the International Literacy Prizes that are specially awarded to programs that help increase the digital literacy rate of marginalized groups, including senior citizen. Additionally, training programs have been launched in many areas that pair undergraduates with low-income older adults for a certain period of time, through which older people can gain digital skills from their younger partners (nih.gov).</p>
    </div>

    <!-- National Perspective -->
    <div id="national" class="section">
        <h2>National Perspective</h2>
        <p>Digital illiteracy is a significant issue in UK. According to Age UK report (2024), around 4.7 million people aged above 65 years do not have basic digital skills like navigating online services and above 2.3 million elder people do not even use the internet. To solve this, UK has introduced “Age UK’s Digital Programme” which provides training and support for the elderly people.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Digital illiteracy is also a substantial issue in Belgium. According to “The Digital Inclusion Barometer”, 32% of the total population of Belgium have low digital skills and 8% have no skills at all. Although the digital literacy has reached the senior citizens but the ones who were above 80, women, and people with low income do not have access to the digital world. Because of this, they cannot use services like online banking and civic participation. To cater this, the government has introduced “Digital Appropriation Plan” and “BeDigitaltogether” which provide training to the people.</p>
        <p>In a developing country like Pakistan, digital illiteracy is more common. According to the study in 2022, the digital literacy rates of the elderly people are below 25% and only 36.5% of the people have access to the internet. Elderly people neither have access to the internet nor the digital skills which makes them dependent on others. To counter this, the government has introduced programmes like “Digital Gender Inclusion Strategy” and digital hubs. These efforts aim to reduce exclusion and expand digital participation across vulnerable groups.</p>
        <p>Lastly in Bangladesh, digital illiteracy among the elderly people is a serious issue. It serves as a barrier to accessing the essential services like e-banking and shopping etc. Many senior citizens of Bangladesh lack basic digital skills like using the internet or web browsers. According to the study conducted by BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD), many rural households have the basic access to the technology but their general skill level is extremely low which makes it difficult to utilize the online services. (Md. Wasel Bin Shadat, 2020) To address this issue, community-based training programs and government initiatives are held which aim to increase the digital literacy among the senior citizens (Shafi, 2023).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="local" class="section">
        <h2>Local Perspective</h2>
        <p>In many urban and semi-urban areas of Punjab, especially Lahore, digital illiteracy limits people’s ability to engage fully in today’s digital world. Most households now have smartphones and internet access, but many residents, particularly older adults and those from low-income neighborhoods, have difficulty using digital tools for everyday tasks. These tasks include online payments, government services, and e-learning. According to a study by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute, the gap between access and ability is a major reason internet adoption in Punjab mostly focuses on social media rather than productive use (INP WealthPK, 2024). The lack of local digital training centers and awareness campaigns has made it hard for people to build confidence in using technology. A 2024 study on Lahore’s public schools found that students with higher digital literacy had better academic performance. This shows that improving digital skills can directly enhance learning outcomes and create new opportunities (PLHR Journal, 2024).</p>
        <p>Digital illiteracy in communities like Lahore thus prevents individuals from accessing important online services and reduces the overall effectiveness of education and employment systems. Strengthening local digital training programs and incorporating technology use into daily school lessons could help bridge this growing gap.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="results" class="section">
        <h2>Results / Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            According to the research conducted, it can be concluded that digital illiteracy among senior citizens is a major issue originated from limited education, lack of exposure and motivation, age-associated physical decline, and mental deterioration. Its consequences	 include social isolation, increase in dependency on others, and inaccessibility of essential services like banking and health care. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Globally, elderly people, ranging from the developed countries of Europe to the developing countries of south Asia, struggle with basic digital tasks like navigating through menus, accessing digital services like e-banking, eHealth etc. In developing countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh, lack of internet and technology fuels this issue. Moreover, in developed nations like UK and Belgium, citizens above the age of 80 or those with low income face such issues. To counter this, respective governments and NGOs are conducting training initiatives, digital inclusion programs and intergenerational mentorships.
        </p>
        <p>
            To summarize, the essence of the research is that digital illiteracy among the senior citizens isolates them from modern life but education, mentorship and affordable access can solve this problem.
